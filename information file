DBTest - Car Database Application
Overview
DBTest is a Java-based application that interacts with a Derby database to manage and display information about cars. The application connects to the database and allows users to query and analyze various car-related data, such as car makes, model years, prices, and more. It provides a simple menu-driven interface to perform various operations.

Features
Display All Car Makes - Lists all unique car makes stored in the database.
Find Oldest Model - Identifies the oldest car model based on the manufacture_year.
Total Value of All Cars - Calculates the total value of all cars in the database.
Most Expensive Car - Finds the car with the highest price.
Least Expensive Car - Finds the car with the lowest price.
Exit - Exits the program.
Requirements
Java 8 or higher
Apache Derby (or any database of your choice with appropriate configurations)
Database Configuration
The application is set up to use an Apache Derby database. The connection URL used in the code is:

java
Copy code
String dbUrl = "jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/Cars";
Make sure to replace this with the actual URL if you're using a different database or path. You will need a database called Cars with the following table structure:

CARS Table Structure
Column	Data Type
make	VARCHAR(255)
model	VARCHAR(255)
manufacture_year	INT
price	DOUBLE
